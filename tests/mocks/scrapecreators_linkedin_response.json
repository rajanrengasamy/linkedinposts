      "text": "Just wrapped up our Q4 AI strategy review. Key insight: companies that treat AI as a tool vs. those building AI-native workflows see dramatically different outcomes.\n\nThe difference isn't the technology - it's the organizational mindset.\n\n3 patterns I observed in top performers:\n\n1. They start with process redesign, not tool adoption\n2. They measure outcomes, not AI usage metrics\n3. They invest heavily in prompt engineering training\n\nWhat patterns are you seeing in successful AI transformations?\n\n#AI #DigitalTransformation #Leadership",

Because building production AI systems is 20% model work and 80% everything else:\n- Data pipeline architecture\n- User experience design\n- Edge case handling\n- Stakeholder communication\n\nWe're over-indexing on ML skills and under-indexing on systems thinking.\n\nAgree or disagree?",

We had no process for handling AI outputs that could affect employment decisions.\n\nNow we're using AI to improve our AI governance.\n\nMeta? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely.\n\nThe tools themselves can help us use them more responsibly.",

Latency measured in milliseconds, not seconds\n3. Works offline - critical for edge computing\n4. 10x cheaper to run than cloud-based LLMs\n\nWe just deployed a 3B parameter model that handles 90% of our customer support queries entirely on-device.\n\nThe future isn't just bigger models. It's smarter deployment.",
